            <strong>Analysis</strong><br>
            The countplot shows that the quality of the wine in the dataset is not balanced, most of the wine quality ratings are mediocore (5-6), and there is no very poor (0-2) and very good (9,10) rated wine. This might be because most of the wine on the market is mediocore. Very poor wine wouldn't sell, and might be hazardous, while very high quality wine is most likely very expensive and has a very niche market.<br><br>

        <p>
            <strong>Analysis</strong><br>
            A quick look at the histogram and boxplot, indicated that the data distributions is not normal, with quite some outliers, especially on the upper/higher values.

For parameters like chloride, volatile acidity and sulfuric compounds ( total and free sulfur dioxide and sulphate), right skewed data (the data mostly concentrated on the left side/ lower values) make sense, since too much of these compounds are unfavorable ( chloride cause saltiness, sulfuric compund and volatile acidity cause strange smell).<br><br>

Alcohol and residual sugar is also right skewed. These pamareters values are highly depending on initial sugar content of the grapes used to make the wines and the yeast used in fermentation. The initial sugar in the grape juice is fermented into alcohol, until the sugar depleted or the yeast died due to high concentration of alcohol. The data shows that in most winemaking, the fermentation happened until the sugar is almost depleted, resulting in alcohol content arounf 10-11%.<br><br>

The density and pH distibution is concentrated in the middle. The mean of the density is 0.997, and the spread out of the data is quite close to this number, which is close to the density of water. While the mean of the pH is 3.3, with the pH ranging from 2.8-4, all indicate acidity.<br><br>

        <p>
            <strong>Analysis</strong><br>
            The correlation matrix and regression plots show that the parameters that is most correlated with the wine quality is alcohol content, they have a positive correlation (the higher the alcohol content, the higher the quality) though the correlation is relatively weak (0.48). <br><br>

Wine quality also weakly correlated with volatile acidity (-0.38) and sulphates (0.38). Volatile acidity can cause vinegar like smell in wine and therefore has a negative correlation with wine quality, while sulphates is an important antimicrobial and antioxidant agent, hence the positive relationship with wine quality. <br><br>

It is interesting to note that all of the above parameters also correlated with other parameters. As example, alcohol, correlated with density, which correlated with fixed acidity, which correlated with pH, etc. From prediction point of view, this shows multicolinearity potential, which can affect the result of linear regression models. From business point of view, this means that the parameters to decide wine quality are related to each other, therefore, a comprehensive analysis is important to keep the quality of wine.<br><br>

Lastly, the lack of strong correlation of the parameters with wine quality indicate that wine rating, which is done through sensory test, can be quite subjective. Having your wine highly rated, doesn't guarantee everyone will love it. <br><br>
